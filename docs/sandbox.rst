Sandbox Module
=============

The Sandbox module creates a tar archive of the scripts to be distributed to the worker nodes at the launch of a PiCaS job. The location of the sandbox is stored in the PiCaS token and upon launch, it is downloaded and extracted. The sandbox is created from a configuration file which defines its name, location scrts repository and any additional processing scripts, such as prefactor.
