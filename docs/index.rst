Welcome to GRID_LRT's documentation!
====================================

This package is built by Alexandar Mechev and the LOFAR e-infra group at Leiden University with the support of SURFsara. The goals of this package is to enable High Throughput processing of LOFAR data on the Dutch GRID infrastructure. We do this by making a set of tools designed to wrap around several different LOFAR processing strategies. These tools are responsible for staging data at the LOFAR Long Term Archives, creating and launching GRID jobs, as well as managing intermediate data on the GRID storage.
